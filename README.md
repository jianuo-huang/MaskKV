## Overview

**MaskKV** is a **training-free framework** that unlocks efficient long-context inference for **Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs)**. It drastically **slashes memory usage** and **accelerates performance**, all while preserving high accuracy.

While dLLMs offer powerful **parallel decoding**, they are bottlenecked by the **massive memory costs** of caching the entire sequence at every step. **MaskKV** tackles this challenge with a **fine-grained KV cache pruning** strategy that leverages signals unique to the diffusion process, moving beyond the limitations of heuristics designed for autoregressive models.

## Core Techniques

### ðŸŸ© Mask-Voting
- Leverages the attention patterns from **[MASK] tokens**, which act as strong indicators of token importance.
- Selectively retains **critical prompt tokens** in the KV cache.

### ðŸ§© Adaptive Budget Allocation
- **Hierarchically allocates cache budget** across layers and attention heads.
- Prioritizes:
  - **Boundary layers** (with the strongest contextual impact)
  - **High-Prompt-Preference heads** (most sensitive to prompt semantics)

## Key Results

Experiments on **LLaDA-8B** and **Dream-7B** show consistent gains in accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage.

| Metric | Result |
|:--|:--|
| **Accuracy** | Retains up to **98.7%** (Dream-7B) and **94.3%** (LLaDA-8B) of full-cache performance on *LongBench* with the cache compressed to just **256 KV pairs** (<5% of tokens). |
| **Speed** | Achieves up to **31Ã— faster decoding** at 32k prompt length |
| **Memory** | Reduces peak memory by **65%**, enabling **8Ã— longer prompts** on a single GPU |
